										<h2 class="major">Trip to Northern Europe</h2>
										<p>Northern Europe is the geographical region in Europe roughly north of the southern coast of the Baltic Sea, which is about 54°N. Narrower definitions may be based on other geographical factors such as climate and ecology. A broader definition would include the area north of the Alps. Countries which are central-western (such as Belgium and Switzerland), central (such as Austria) or central-eastern (such as Hungary and Poland) are not usually considered part of either Northern or Southern Europe.

Historically, when Europe was dominated by the Roman Empire, everything not near the Mediterranean region was termed Northern European[citation needed], including southern Germany, all of the Low Countries, and Austria. This meaning is still used today in some contexts, for example, discussions of the Northern Renaissance.</p>

										<h2 class="major">NCCU</h2>
										<p>National Chengchi University, referred to as Zhengda University, was founded in 1927 in Nanjing, Jiangsu. It was approved by the Executive Yuan in 1954, and re-established in Taipei, Taiwan. It is the first national university in Taiwan to be re-established in Taiwan. The founding mission is one of the central universities responsible for cultivating national political, management and legal talents. It has subsequently developed into a national university focusing on the humanities and social sciences in Taiwan, and has become one of the important think tanks in Asia and the Pacific.

In terms of academic and school development, the National Chengchi University was founded on the foundation of the National Central University in Nanjing. After the resumption of Taiwan, it also enjoys good social evaluation with the National Taiwan University in Taipei and other schools. . And has a close relationship with the National Yangming University of Taipei in the research of mental and brain sciences

The National Chengchi University not only uses Chinese from both sides of the Taiwan Straits as its main source of students, but also attracts many overseas international students</p>
